This tutorial demonstrates how to use cross-modal data programming to train a Convolutional Neural Network on the OpenI chest radiograph dataset.  The entire tutorial is contained within `openi_demo/open_demo.ipynb`.  

Steps to set up the tutorial are as follows:

(1) Install Snorkel MeTaL and requirements by running `pip install --requirement python-package-requirements.txt`

(2) Run `download.sh` within the `openi_demo/data` subdirectory

(3) Run `jupyter notebook` from the current directory

(4) Open the `openi_demo/openi_demo.ipynb` notebook

(5) Enjoy the tutorial!

Labeling functions (LFs) for each application studied in our recent work can be found in the `lfs` directory.
